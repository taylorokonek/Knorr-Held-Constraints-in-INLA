# Constraints in INLA

How to *correctly* specify constraints for Knorr-Held Type II - IV Gaussian Markov Random Fields in INLA (but also any GMRF with a singular precision matrix, generally speaking).

## Reposity Contents

* example.R: All the code you will need to walk through a simple example for Ohio. Will give you examples for Type II - IV random effects *as well as* literally any precision matrix using nice linear algebra facts.
* ohioadj.asc: The graph file you'll need to run the example code.

Details are in commented sections of example.R!
